## You said #1

> regarding OWASP vulnerabilities. 2FA addresses one of them.. which one does address?

## ChatGPT said #1

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) primarily addresses OWASP’s “Broken Authentication” vulnerability.

Here’s why:

- Broken Authentication refers to weaknesses in how applications manage credentials and sessions (e.g., weak passwords, credential stuffing, brute force, session hijacking).
- 2FA mitigates these risks because even if an attacker steals or guesses a user’s password, they still need the second factor (something the user has, like a phone or token; or something they are, like biometrics).
- This makes brute force, credential stuffing, and stolen password attacks much less effective.

👉 So, to answer directly: 2FA mitigates the risk of “Broken Authentication” in the OWASP Top 10.

Would you like me to also explain how 2FA indirectly touches on other OWASP risks (like “Credential Stuffing” under Broken Authentication, or “Phishing” under Social Engineering) so you have a fuller picture?

## You said #2

> what would be its CWE?

## ChatGPT said #2

Great question 👌

The OWASP Top 10 entries usually map to CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) entries. For Broken Authentication, the relevant CWE that 2FA helps mitigate is:

- CWE-287: Improper Authentication
    - This covers cases where authentication is missing, implemented incorrectly, or not sufficiently strong (e.g., relying only on a password).

2FA directly reduces the impact of CWE-287 because it strengthens authentication beyond just one factor.

Depending on context, it can also mitigate related CWEs such as:

- CWE-308: Use of Single-Factor Authentication (very direct fit — 2FA fixes this).
- CWE-307: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (because even if brute force is possible, the attacker still needs the second factor).
- CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials (indirectly — 2FA lessens impact if static creds are leaked).

👉 But the primary CWE link for 2FA is CWE-287 (Improper Authentication), with CWE-308 (Single-Factor Auth) being the closest match when talking specifically about password-only logins.

Would you like me to map this precisely to OWASP Top 10 2021 → CWE mapping so you can see the official linkage?

## You said #3

> from the 10 categories what category does it belong?

## ChatGPT said #3

Got it 👍

From the OWASP Top 10 (2021) categories, 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) directly addresses:

- A07: Identification and Authentication Failures

(formerly called Broken Authentication in OWASP Top 10 2017).

This category covers weaknesses in how applications authenticate users, such as:

- weak or missing MFA (multi-factor authentication),
- allowing brute-force/credential stuffing,
- improper session management,
- password-only authentication.

👉 So the short answer: 2FA belongs under A07: Identification and Authentication Failures. ✅

Do you want me to also show you how OWASP maps A07 → CWE entries so you can see the exact standard cross-reference?

## You said #4

> under what category does CWE-352 does it fall into?

## ChatGPT said #4

Good question 👍

CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) falls under:

OWASP Top 10 (2021)

👉 A05: Security Misconfiguration (in older mappings it was separate, but in 2021 OWASP merged CSRF under this broader category).

OWASP Top 10 (2017)

👉 A8: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (it had its own dedicated category back then).

So:

- If you’re referencing OWASP Top 10 2021 → CWE mapping → CWE-352 is mapped under A05: Security Misconfiguration.
- If referencing OWASP Top 10 2017 → it’s directly A8: CSRF.

⚡ Would you like me to pull up the official OWASP 2021 → CWE cross-reference table for you so you can see exactly how each CWE is grouped?

## You said #5

> can you tell under what category does CWE-550 falls into?

## ChatGPT said #5

You're asking about CWE-550: Server-generated Error Message Containing Sensitive Information—here’s how it maps to OWASP Top 10:

What is CWE-550?

CWE-550 refers to server-generated error messages that unintentionally expose sensitive information (like stack traces, detailed error codes, or internal configuration details) to users or attackers. Such information can be leveraged to aid further attacks. (cwe.mitre.org)

It’s categorized as a Variant-level weakness, meaning it’s specific and tied to particular technologies or implementations, but retains enough generality to be actionable. (cwe.mitre.org)

Which OWASP Top 10 category does CWE-550 fall under?

CWE-550 maps to OWASP Top 10 2021’s:

- A04:2021 – Insecure Design

This category covers design-level faults and architectural issues that can lead to security flaws—even if subsequent implementation is sound. Specifically, this includes poor error-handling practices that leak sensitive internal information. (owasp.org)

Within A04, a relevant related CWE is:

- CWE-209 – Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information, which is a base-level weakness and indeed grouped under A04. Since CWE-550 is a variant of that, it naturally inherits the same classification. (cwe.mitre.org)

Summary

- CWE-550 — Server-generated error message containing sensitive information (Variant) → A04:2021 – Insecure Design (via CWE-209)

Additional Context

- In OWASP 2017, similar weaknesses were often grouped under A6: Security Misconfiguration, since verbose or misconfigured error messages are seen as configuration issues rather than design flaws.
- However, OWASP 2021 shifted its focus to root causes. Leak-prone error handling is viewed as a design failure—thus the reassignment to Insecure Design (A04).

So to answer concisely:

- CWE-550 falls into OWASP Top 10 2021 category A04: Insecure Design, primarily through its broader base-level CWE-209 (error message leakage) classification.

Let me know if you want to dive into other CWEs, how they map across OWASP editions, or examples of how such design flaws get exploited in real apps!

## You said #6

> can you tell under what category does CWE-1295 falls into?

## ChatGPT said #6

You're asking about CWE-1295: Debug Messages Revealing Unnecessary Information—which category does it fall into within the OWASP Top 10?

What is CWE-1295?

This CWE refers to the scenario where a system exposes unnecessary or sensitive information through debug messages—like internal memory dumps, detailed error traces, cryptographic info, configuration data, etc.—that could aid attackers in reconnaissance or exploitation. (cwe.mitre.org)

OWASP Top 10 Category Mapping

While I couldn't find a direct, official mapping of CWE-1295 → OWASP Top 10, we can infer the most relevant category based on its characteristics:

- A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration

This category includes issues where systems leak overly informative or sensitive data via misconfigured error handling or debug outputs (owasp.org). Given CWE-1295's nature—revealing internal details through debug messages—it fits logically within A05: Security Misconfiguration under the 2021 version of the OWASP Top 10.

Summary

- CWE-1295 — Debug messages that reveal unnecessary (and possibly sensitive) system information → A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration (best fit)

If you'd like a deeper dive into mappings for adjacent CWEs like CWE-209 (Error Messages Containing Sensitive Information)—which clearly maps to A04: Insecure Design—I’d be happy to walk you through those too!

## You said #7

> under what category does CWE-1275 falls into?

## ChatGPT said #7

You're asking about CWE-1275: Sensitive Cookie with Improper SameSite Attribute — let's map that to the appropriate OWASP Top 10 2021 category.

What is CWE-1275?

CWE-1275 is a variant-level weakness describing when an application sets a sensitive cookie—such as a session token—without a secure SameSite attribute, or with an insecure value (like SameSite=None without secure flags), which can expose the cookie to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities. (cwe.mitre.org)

Which OWASP Top 10 category does CWE-1275 belong to?

According to mapping data:

- CWE-1275 is explicitly mapped to OWASP Top 10 2021 → A01: Broken Access Control.
- Additionally, ZAP (a popular web security scanner) associates the alert for SameSite misconfiguration (CWE-1275) with both OWASP 2017 A5 and OWASP 2021 A01.

At a glance

- CWE-1275 — Sensitive cookie set without or with improper SameSite attribute → A01:2021 – Broken Access Control

Why Broken Access Control?

While it's about cookie configuration, the core risk is that without proper SameSite enforcement, attackers may perform cross-site actions using authenticated cookies—effectively bypassing intended access restrictions. Hence, it's categorized under Broken Access Control, focusing on unauthorized use of credentials via CSRF rather than being classified as a misconfiguration or cryptographic failure.

Let me know if you'd like to explore how this compares to related CWEs like CWE-312 (cleartext storage) or CWE-209 (error message leakage) and where they fit in OWASP's taxonomy!

## You said #8

> what category does CWE-829 does fall into?

## ChatGPT said #8

Good one 👍

CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere

🔎 What it means

This weakness happens when software includes code, libraries, plugins, or functionality from untrusted sources (e.g., pulling a script from an unverified CDN, dynamically loading untrusted modules, etc.). Attackers can replace or tamper with those external components to compromise the system.

📌 OWASP Top 10 Mapping

In the OWASP Top 10 (2021), CWE-829 falls under:

- A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components
    - This category covers using libraries, frameworks, or components from untrusted or outdated sources without verifying their integrity, trustworthiness, or patch level.

✅ Summary

- CWE-829 — Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere → A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Would you like me to also show you the official MITRE–OWASP mapping table reference so you can trace how CWE-829 links to A06 directly?

## You said #9

> regarding CWE-494 using CDNs in html would be consider a evidence or a vulnerability of this type?

## ChatGPT said #9

Excellent question 👌

Let’s break it down:

🔎 CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check

This weakness occurs when software downloads or loads code without verifying its integrity, such as not using signatures, hashes, or integrity attributes. An attacker could tamper with the code in transit or compromise the hosting source.

🌐 Using CDNs in HTML

When you include JavaScript or CSS from a CDN, for example:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js"></script>
```

- If you don’t use integrity mechanisms like Subresource Integrity (SRI) (integrity + crossorigin attributes), you’re exposed: if the CDN or the connection is compromised, malicious code could be injected.

If you do use SRI:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js"
    integrity="sha384-abc123..."
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

…then you mitigate CWE-494, because the browser will verify the code hash before executing it.

⚖️ Evidence vs. Vulnerability

- Evidence: Simply finding that an app loads scripts from a CDN without SRI is evidence pointing to CWE-494.
- Vulnerability: It becomes a confirmed CWE-494 vulnerability if the code is actually being downloaded without any integrity verification (no SRI, no TLS pinning, etc.).

So:

- CDN usage alone is not a vulnerability (it’s common practice).
- CDN usage without integrity checks → evidence of CWE-494.
- If verified in practice (no SRI + risk of tampering), then it’s a CWE-494 vulnerability.

✅ Answer: Using CDNs in HTML without integrity checks (e.g., SRI) would be considered evidence of CWE-494, and if confirmed, it is a vulnerability of that type.

Do you want me to also show you how tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp flag this in reports (they usually phrase it as “external script without SRI”)?

## You said #13

> under what category does CWE-598 falls into

## ChatGPT said #13

Good question 👍

🔎 CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings

This weakness happens when an application uses HTTP GET (instead of POST or another safer method) to transmit sensitive data in query strings. Since query strings can be logged, cached, or exposed in browser history, this creates a risk of information disclosure.

📌 OWASP Top 10 Mapping (2021)

CWE-598 maps to:

- A01:2021 – Broken Access Control (in some mappings, because improper request handling may allow unauthorized access if sensitive tokens are leaked).
- A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures (more commonly, since the core issue is sensitive data exposure due to insecure transport mechanisms).

👉 In the official OWASP 2021 → CWE mapping, CWE-598 is classified under A02: Cryptographic Failures.

✅ Summary

- CWE-598 — Use of GET Request with Sensitive Query Strings → A02: Cryptographic Failures

Would you like me to pull up the official OWASP Top 10 2021 → CWE cross-reference table so you can directly see where CWE-598 sits?
