The Web Application should include the following functionalities for the BookShop Admin:
Log in and log out of the system. You can assume that admins are already registered with a pre-defined username and password. So, they will only need to perform login and logout operations.
Add/edit/delete books. After logging in, an admin can add, edit, and delete books. Each book should include the title, author, year, price, and number of copies. 


The Web Application will include the following functionalities for Customers
Register in the BookShop: Customers can register by providing their details (name, surname, date of birth,  address, phone number, email address). 
Login and logout of the system. Registered customers can perform the login and should be able to log out after performing the login.
Look at the available books. A customer can explore the list of available books without being logged in.
Add a book to the cart. A customer can add a book to the cart after logging in.
View the cart. After logging in, a customer can view the items in the cart, their price and the total price. The cart can be an entity stored in the database.
Remove items from the cart. After logging in, a customer can remove items from the cart if they have any.
Place order.  After logging in, a customer with a cart containing at least one item can place an order.
